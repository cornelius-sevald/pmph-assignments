**Note:**

1. All benchmarks were done on gpu02.
2. To enable the optimizations in task 1 and 2, either export the environment
   variables `TASK1` and `TASK2` e.g. `TASK1=on make` or pass the options to the
   make command e.g. `make TASK2=on`. The actual values of `TASK1` and `TASK2`
   don't matter.
   I know the names are confusing (`TASK1` for task 2 and `TASK2` for task 3),
   it was to stay consistent with the comments in the source files that call
   them task 1 and task 2.
